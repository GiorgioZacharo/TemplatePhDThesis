PhD program director agrees with proceeding with the defense.
A defense has to take place at USI and cannot take place on public
holidays. The more senior of the two internal committee members
chairs the defense.
At least two weeks before the date of the defense the Deanâ€™s Office
sends an announcement with the date, time, location, the list of the
dissertation committee members, and the title and abstract of the
dissertation.
At least one week before the date of the defense the research
advisor must send the thesis assessment reports to the chair before
the defense.

member must be present in person at the defense
